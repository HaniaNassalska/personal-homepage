        <Info>Hello! My name is Hania and this is my personal page.</Info>
        <Info>
          I'm a Front-end developer with over 2,5 years of experience. I work at
          Faktura.pl, where Iâ€™m responsible for application development and bug
          fixing, using Angular, AngularJS, and PHP on a regular basis. I focus
          on code quality, UI, and the finer details of tasks.
        </Info>
        <Info>
          I also have experience as a Project Manager. I worked in an
          organization, Fundacja Widzialni (Widzalni.eu), that promotes Web
          Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). During my time there, I
          decided to broaden my IT knowledge, particularly in Front-end
          development, to enhance my skills as an IT Project Manager. However,
          after starting, I realized that I didn't want to be a PM, but rather a
          Developer â€“ because I enjoyed it so much!
        </Info>
        <Info>
          Iâ€™m very determined, thatâ€™s why I try harder than others! Iâ€™m an
          open-minded person. I like learning new things and I know how to look
          for answers to questions. I want to learn more and more!
        </Info>
        <Info>
          In addition, I have completed approximately 60 projects, ranging from
          comprehensive applications to task-based projects. You can find them
          below. ðŸ˜‰
