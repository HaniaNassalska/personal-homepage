        <Info>Hello! My name is Hania and this is my personal page.</Info>
        <Info>
          I have 1.5 years of experience in Front-end. I have created around 60
          projects, both comprehensive applications and task-based projects,
          including team projects - you can find them below! I work in React,
          TypeScript, Node.js, HTML, CSS, Sass and Iâ€™m not stopping there!
        </Info>
        <Info>How did my Front-end adventure start?</Info>
        <Info>
          In my previous job, I worked in a team with Web Developers as a
          Project Manager and IT started to fascinate me - so I decided to try
          it. At first, I wanted to improve my skills as an IT Project Manager,
          but I fell in love with programming and decided to become a Front-end
          Developer myself.
        </Info>
        <Info>
          Iâ€™m very determined, thatâ€™s why I try harder than others! Iâ€™m an
          open-minded person. I like learning new things and I know how to look
          for answers to questions. I want to learn more and more! Right now, I
          am developing my Full-stack skills (Node.js).
        </Info>
        <Info>
          PS: Don't be surprised if you find some strange repo - I'm probably
          learning something new at the moment. ðŸ˜‰
